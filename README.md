## Info ++
Creating a calculator is one of the most basic exercises for a software developer, so I've decided to try this exercise, and experiment on JAVA SWING technology, this was a new for me, being that even though the BootCamp, JAVA was the go-to language, SWING components were not used.
It was a fun little project.


## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK Java Version 8
- JAVA SWING
